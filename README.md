# AzureBudgetsWLogicApp
A common budgets scenario for a customer running a non-critical workload could occur when they want to manage against a budget and also get to a predictable cost when looking at the monthly invoice. This scenario requires some cost-based orchestration of resources that are part of the Azure environment. In this scenario, a monthly budget of $1000 for the subscription is set. Also, notification thresholds are set to trigger a few orchestrations. This scenario starts with an 80% cost threshold, which will stop all VMs in the resource group Optional. Then, at the 100% cost threshold, all VM instances will be stopped.
